# Stock Investment Decision Helper

A Streamlit application to help manage investment portfolios and optimize trading decisions.

## Features

### Real-Time Prices

The application now supports real-time stock prices from Yahoo Finance:

- **Automatic Price Fetching**: When enabled, the app automatically fetches current market prices for all stocks in your portfolio.
- **Manual Price Lookup**: For new stocks being added, use the "Get Price" button to fetch the current market price.
- **Price Refresh**: Update all prices with a single click using the "Refresh Prices" button.
- **Special Security Handling**: The app intelligently handles different security types including stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds (like VDIGX).
- **No API Key Required**: Uses the free yfinance package which doesn't require authentication.

To use this feature:

1. Make sure the "Use Real-Time Prices" checkbox is selected in the sidebar (enabled by default).
2. When adding new stocks, click "Get Price" to fetch current market prices.
3. Use the "Refresh Prices" button to update all prices at once.
